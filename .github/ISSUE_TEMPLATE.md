If you've come straight to the issue tracker out of habit, you might want to read the [Getting Help](http://ensime.github.io/getting_help/) section of the documentation.

If it still looks like a bug and you've come back here, be aware that there is very little we can do unless you provide us with a reproduction of the problem:

1. a standalone (ideally minimal) project on github
2. step by step instructions to trigger the bug (videos are useful)

The next step is for us to help you create a test that fails. Bug reports in the form of a pull request into the `src/sbt-test/ensime-sbt` directory are well received and are significantly more likely to be fixed. It is our suite of integration tests using the [sbt scripted](http://eed3si9n.com/testing-sbt-plugins) framework (its very simple to use).

We'll give as much help as we can, our goal is to grow this community.
